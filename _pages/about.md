I'm Kaushal Yagnik, currently working as a Data Scientist at Microsoft Bangalore. I'm passionate about using applied Machine Learning concepts for building impactful solutions by using the humongous amount of data which is being generated daily.  

My research interests include applied machine learning, machine learning on large datasets, optimization and game theory. Recently, my passion for music has inspired me to dig deeper into the interplay of music and machine learning. I aspire to make a state-of-the-art machine learning system which captures the emotion of a song and suggests similar songs according to user's temporal emotional state.
