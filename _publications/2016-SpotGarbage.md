A smart phone app to detect and segment garbage in unconstrained real-world images using state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning techniques.
The app, SpotGarbage, allows people to click an image and send the prediction information (with geo coordinates) to the municipality for clean-up. The app can be seen in actions in this [Youtube video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTkCsz5C8zs)

A webservice has been deployed at [http://spotgarbage.com](http://spotgarbage.com) with a ready to use free API available on [Mashape here](https://market.mashape.com/g1910/spotgarbage).

Abstract:  
Maintaining a clean and hygienic civic environment is an indispensable yet formidable task, especially in developing countries. With the aim of engaging citizens to track and report on their neighborhoods, this paper presents a novel smartphone app, called SpotGarbage, which detects and coarsely segments garbage regions in a user-clicked geo-tagged image. The app utilizes the proposed deep architecture of fully convolutional networks for detecting garbage in images. The model has been trained on a newly introduced Garbage In Images (GINI) dataset, achieving a mean accuracy of 87.69%. The paper also proposes optimizations in the network architecture resulting in a reduction of 87.9% in memory usage and 96.8% in prediction time with no loss in accuracy, facilitating its usage in resource constrained smartphones.
